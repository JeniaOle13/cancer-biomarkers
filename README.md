## Overview  
This repository contains the computational workflows and scripts used to analyze 624 stool metagenomes from 11 cohorts to identify microbial biomarkers of cancer immunotherapy response. Key findings include:  
- **Blautia species** as keystone taxa linked to immunotherapy success.  
- **Oral/food-derived microbes** (e.g., *Veillonella*, *Klebsiella*) as predictors of non-response.
